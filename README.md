Setting up this repository as a template for starting other projects. It sets up a nice reproducable, but extreamly simple environment for data science or other work. Maybe someday I'll work it up into a cookie cutter or something. For now just use the Makefile to get started.

# Prerequisites

`make`
`docker`

That's it! Honeslty you dont even need make!

# Check out the make file for some commands to get you started

The two main ones you may want are:

`make start`

`make bash`
